The City of Rochester is resurgent. Historically 
one of America’s ﬁ  rst “boomtowns,” Rochester 
has more recently endured a half-century of decline, causing job-loss, reduced private sector sources of regional funding, and a high percentage of poverty-stricken ci Ɵ zens. 
Today, our city is experiencing a wave of revitalizaƟ on. Thousands of units of new 
housing have or soon will be built in the Center City, and an emerging Downtown InnovaƟ on Zone is genera Ɵ ng high quality 
jobs and investment. These combined forces have changed the fortunes of our urban core, where the focus is now on managing growth rather than stemming decline. Whether dissecƟ  ng the Midtown Plaza superblock, 
removing the sunken Inner Loop Expressway, developing intermodal transporta Ɵ on hubs, or 
aggressively building out an extensive bicycle network, the City of Rochester is commiƩ  ed to 
creaƟ ng a smart, sustainable city for the 21st 
Century.
However, our city and region faces a cri Ɵ cal 
test that will determine whether or not that 
21st Century city meets the needs of all of our residents. In spite of its abundant resources and apparent wealth, Rochester, when compared to other mid-sized ci Ɵ es, is home 
to a crippling concentra Ɵ on of urban poverty. 
Recent studies indicate that Rochester has the highest rate of child poverty, the highest rate of extreme poverty, and the second-highest rate of poverty overall in the na Ɵ on. Unless the 
rate and scale of poverty in our community is addressed, the city and region will struggle to meet its full poten Ɵ al.
Through the leadership of Mayor Lovely Warren and Governor Andrew Cuomo, in coordinaƟ on with a broad public, private, 
and non-pro ﬁ t iniƟ aƟ ve, the community has 
targeted a 50% reduc Ɵ on in poverty over the next 15 years. To that end, Rochester recognizes the unique opportunity that the Smart City Challenge provides to dedicate technological advancements in the transporta Ɵ on sector to achieve our goal of 
reducing urban poverty and improving the quality of life for all ci Ɵ zens. This will be done 
in three ways: improving safety for travelling ciƟ zens, enhancing mobility by crea Ɵ ng more 
and beƩ er travel op Ɵ ons, and advancing 
environmental sustainability by reducing energy consump Ɵ on and greenhouse gases 
(GHG). 
By invesƟ ng in the Smart City Challenge and 
leveraging private sector funds, we will be 
able to enhance long-term transporta Ɵ on 
soluƟ ons that be Ʃ er connect communi Ɵ es 
to employment centers, educa Ɵ on centers, 
health care facili Ɵ es, and services. The City 
of Rochester and its assembled consor Ɵ um 
of partners, is commiƩ  
ed to successful 
implementa Ɵ on of the Smart City Challenge. If 
awarded, the results achieved in Rochester will be replicable in ci Ɵ es across the country.
TransportaƟ  on & Poverty
Transporta Ɵ on has played a regre Ʃ able 
role in crea Ɵ ng an environment in which 
poverty can concentrate and spread. CiƟ  es 
have historically grown outward with each transporta Ɵ on innova Ɵ on as faster, more 
eﬃ  cient transporta Ɵ on services enabled 
people to live further from the historic center. This phenomenon is nothing new. However, the prolifera Ɵ on of the car, coupled with 
supporƟ ve infrastructure, land use, and 
ﬁ nancial policies, enabled this to take place on 
a massive scale beginning in the 1950s.
The impact on ci Ɵ es such as Rochester was 
two-fold. First and foremost, suburbaniza Ɵ on 
robbed ci Ɵ es of a signi ﬁ cant share of their 
middle and upper-income families, leaving Our goal is to reduce poverty by 50% in 15 years, using 
our Smart City Vision as a driving force of change. 
City of Rochester, NY | 1ROC FORWARD»»»behind a largely poor and working-class 
populace. The City of Rochester’s popula Ɵ on 
peaked in 1950 at over 330,000; today, the City’s popula Ɵ on is just over 210,000, a loss 
of more than one-third. Secondly, the rush to serve the car and compete with suburban development led ciƟ  es to make poor decisions 
or allow such decisions to be made on their behalf. These decisions included wholesale demoliƟ on of neighborhoods to accommodate 
interstates and expressways, o Ō en built 
through established African-American communi Ɵ es; widening of streets to increase 
vehicular throughput, typically at the expense of bicyclists and pedestrians; removal of streetcar and trolley lines from city streets and corridors; and demoli Ɵ on of historic buildings 
and streets in favor of parking facili Ɵ es and 
car-oriented development. 
Rochester, like many ci Ɵ es, was scarred by 
these decisions. As much of the historic 
fabric of the city was destroyed, the social networks that bound residents and businesses together were lost as well. As people le Ō  
the city, businesses followed, crea Ɵ ng a 
downward spiral of disinvestment in many neighborhoods. This also created a spa Ɵ al 
mismatch between new job opportuni Ɵ es and 
lower-income residents. As jobs migrated to the periphery, inner city residents’ ability to access them became strained; this, combined with a host of other factors, ul Ɵ mately resulted 
in chronic unemployment and poverty in city neighborhoods.Transporta Ɵ on is neither the cause of nor 
soluƟ on to poverty. However, it is undeniable 
that transporta Ɵ on is a contribu Ɵ ng factor 
and that e ﬀ orts to improve accessibility and 
mobility for all residents can signi ﬁ cantly 
improve outcomes for our city’s most disadvantaged. Take Sheila for example; she resides in a city neighborhood and works a low-wage job at a small manufacturer a short walk from home. Sheila is able to stay out of poverty in part because, although she does not own a car, most everything she needs is located within her local community. Day care, grocery, health care, and employment are all within easy reach. 
However, the employer decides to relocate the 
business to a suburban site ten miles away. The new locaƟ on is too far to walk or bike and is 
poorly served by transit. Sheila cannot a ﬀ ord a 
car on her salary and must rely on the current transit service. Because bus service is not as frequent in this low-density suburban area, she must now add 90 minutes to her daily commute each way. Her day care provider can no longer accommodate her child’s schedule and so a new provider is found, adding another 30 minutes to the commute. Sheila’s health and that of her child su ﬀ er as doctor visits 
must be curtailed. She o Ō en shows up late to 
work due to the ﬂ  uctuaƟ ons in travel Ɵ mes 
caused by tra ﬃ  c condiƟ ons, weather, and 
other events out of her control. This prompts her employer to terminate her posiƟ  on. With 
no comparable employment opportuni Ɵ es in

now living in poverty.
This is a very common scenario playing out 
in Rochester and in ci Ɵ es naƟ onwide. Unless 
addressed, it threatens our na Ɵ on’s future 
economic compe Ɵ Ɵ veness. Yet it presents a 
unique opportunity to use the resources of the Smart City Challenge to make our ci Ɵ es’ future 
transporta Ɵ on system work for all residents. 
This is Rochester’s challenge - one that we are well prepared to address.
Mayor Warren has taken steps to drive change, 
launching the Mayor’s O ﬃ  ce of Innova Ɵ on 
and Strategic Ini Ɵ aƟ ves, and leading the 
Rochester-Monroe An Ɵ -Poverty Ini Ɵ aƟ ve 
(RMAPI). Together with key agency partners, the City is preparing new program and policy recommenda Ɵ ons to impact poverty, including 
issues of transporta Ɵ on. The program has 
state level support from the oﬃ   ce of Governor 
Cuomo and direct communica Ɵ ons with a task 
force comprised of high level New York State oﬃ  cials. Governor Cuomo is already poin Ɵ ng 
to the eﬀ ort as an example for other states to 
follow.RMAPI and the City recently approved an anƟ -poverty target area encompassing three 
conƟ  guous neighborhoods. This target area 
will be where we will test and measure the impact of new an Ɵ -poverty strategies. The 
area was selected through a data driven process that iden Ɵ ﬁ ed an area with good 
exisƟ ng resources that is impacted by 
socioeconomic issues. The O ﬃ  ce of Innova Ɵ on 
will help design programs with data sharing best pracƟ  ces, and ensure capabili Ɵ es to track 
long term individual outcomes. The O ﬃ  ce will 
also be retained to evaluate program impact, and help make modi ﬁ caƟ ons when necessary. 
Given the a Ʃ enƟ 
on, investment, data sharing, 
and evalua Ɵ on about to occur within this 
area, it is an ideal loca Ɵ on to also pilot new 
transporta Ɵ on technologies designed to 
posiƟ vely impact people in poverty.

City of Rochester, NY | 3ROC FORWARD»»»Our Proposed Elements
The City of Rochester and its partners intend to 
develop a 21st Century transporta Ɵ on system 
that addresses our mobility and safety needs while growing the local and regional economy and oﬀ ering a stairway out of poverty. A 
primary focus will be on enhancing transit accessibility for our residents, 73% of whom are underserved by public transporta Ɵ on. 
We must face our challenges directly, creaƟ ng a path to quality jobs for our ci Ɵ zens 
while building a more robust and smart transporta Ɵ on system. This is consistent with 
our stated vision and with the USDOT Ladders of Opportunity Ini Ɵ aƟ ve promoted under 
Secretary Foxx’s leadership. By inves Ɵ ng in 
Rochester’s Smart City vision and leveraging private sector funding, we will create an enhanced transporta Ɵ on network that be Ʃ er 
connects our residents to employment, educaƟ on, health care, and other services. 
Our goal is to accelerate ongoing e ﬀ orts to re-
establish Rochester as a global innova Ɵ on hub. 
Through this program, we can create up to 10,000 high quality jobs in Rochester by 2020 and rebuild our manufacturing base in the process. The City and region are determined to work with our partners in the public and private sectors to have Connected Shared Automated Vehicles (CSAV) built in Rochester and the USA. We are engaged in preliminary discussions with EasyMile, one of our key partners in this endeavor, regarding this manufacturing facility. 
The USDOT Smart City Challenge has shone 
a light on innova Ɵ ve opera Ɵ onal strategies 
and technologies such as connected vehicles (CV) and automated vehicles (AV), o ﬀ ering 
new hope for addressing the complex transporta Ɵ on challenges we face as a 
naƟ on and nourishing hopes for con Ɵ nued 
economic prosperity. It’s clear that we cannot rely on past solu Ɵ ons to work in today’s 
environment. Ci Ɵ es like Rochester constantly 
face the dilemma of doing more with less. The growing frustra Ɵ on of travelers, combined 
with worsening infrastructure performance, demand that new and innova Ɵ ve strategies be 
developed. The applica Ɵ on of CSAV shu Ʃ les 
for the ﬁ  rst and last mile o ﬀ ers the poten Ɵ al for signi ﬁ cant performance improvements 
at much lower costs and in much faster Ɵ meframes than previously possible. These 
soluƟ ons are scalable and synergize with 
our City’s investments in mul Ɵ -modal 
transporta Ɵ on improvements to meet the 
needs of our residents, now and in the future. 
The City of Rochester has assembled an 
impressive consor Ɵ um of local, regional, and 
state agencies and organiza Ɵ ons, 
 insƟ tuƟ ons 
of higher learning, and industry partners who are commiƩ  ed to the success of Rochester’s 
vision for the Smart City Challenge and addressing an Ɵ -poverty iniƟ  aƟ ves. Highlights 
of the primary proposed elements are listed below:
Urban Automa Ɵ on – partnership 
between the City, EasyMile, Kodak, and the Rochester Genesee Regional Transporta Ɵ on Authority 
(RGRTA) to deploy automated 
transit shu Ʃ les on the internal street network 
of Eastman Business Park (EBP), a 1,200-acre private technology campus in the City of Rochester. This will solve ﬁ rst/last-mile 
issues with transit accessibility, demonstrate the eﬀ ecƟ veness of automated transit, 
and posiƟ on EBP and Rochester for future 
economic growth. Upon successful tes Ɵ ng 
at EBP , it is an Ɵ cipated that deployment 
would transi Ɵ on to public streets in the City 
of Rochester, with early deployment focused on the an Ɵ -poverty target area and/or the 
Downtown Innova Ɵ on Zone. The City will work 
with New York State to enact legisla Ɵ on that 
facilitates automated vehicle deployment iniƟ ally in Rochester and then expanding 
statewide. 
Intelligent, Sensor-Based Infrastructure – partnership between the City and GE to deploy GE’s Current technology via the City’s extensive street ligh Ɵ ng 
system. This technology uses 
intelligent LED light ﬁ xtures ou ƞ iƩ ed with 
sensors, transmiƩ  ers, and microprocessors 
to create a comprehensive data grid oﬀ  ering 
unparalleled possibili Ɵ es for a variety of 
considera Ɵ ons, such as tra ﬃ  c opƟ mizaƟ on, 
parking management, asset oversight, and environmental awareness.
City of Rochester, NY | 4ROC FORWARD»»»Urban Analy Ɵ cs – partnership 
between IBM, RIT, and the City 
to harness the power of Big Data and RIT’s intellectual capacity to 
address a wide variety of municipal 
needs, such as performance measurement, service delivery op Ɵ mizaƟ on, and public 
informaƟ on sharing.
User-Focused Mobility Services and Choices  – partnership between 
Xerox, RGRTA, shared mobility service providers, and the City to develop a leading edge applica Ɵ on 
for real-Ɵ  me transporta Ɵ on informa Ɵ on to 
enable be Ʃ er decision-making with respect 
to travel op Ɵ ons and integrated payment for 
those opƟ ons. This will advance the “Mobility 
on Demand” concept and facilitate more of our residents to choose car-free or car-light lifestyles. Interoperable, mobile fare payment combining a wide variety of travel op Ɵ ons 
(transit, rideshare, carshare, bikeshare, taxi, parking, etc.) is the goal and equitable access for un-banked residents without access to credit is a primary considera Ɵ on.
Urban Delivery & Logis Ɵ cs – 
partnership between Verdant Global and the City to establish a highly-e ﬃ  cient, automated 
AgriFactory at an exis Ɵ ng vacant 
warehouse in the City of Rochester. The Verdant AgriFactory will demonstrate a leap beyond tradi Ɵ onal greenhouse produc Ɵ on, 
yielding signi ﬁ cantly more fresh healthy 
produce than previously thought possible while also repurposing exis Ɵ ng vacant 
warehouse space that is easily accessible to urban popula Ɵ ons. This technological 
advancement has the poten Ɵ al to signi ﬁ cantly 
reduce emissions by elimina Ɵ ng ineﬃ  cient 
long-range transport of produce. Its fully automated system lends itself to local distribuƟ on via connected and/or automated 
vehicles, just-in- Ɵ me delivery techniques, and 
use of analy Ɵ cs to minimize con ﬂ icts between 
delivery and tra ﬃ  c needs on city streets.
Implementa Ɵ on of Rochester’s vision for a 
Smart City will enable the USA to demonstrate global leadership in these emerging technologies, clearing the way for safer, more mobile, and sustainable ci Ɵ es. Furthermore, successful implementa Ɵ on will help Rochester, 
and ciƟ es naƟ on
wide, a Ʃ ack urban poverty 
and improve the quality of life for those living in poverty. Rochester is a smaller city, enabling us to be more nimble and allowing the federal dollars to fund more innova Ɵ ve soluƟ ons. 
Our collabora Ɵ ve, coopera Ɵ ve environment 
minimizes risk, providing assurance that our city and region is focused on delivering a Smart City focused on the future. The consorƟ um that will guide this investment 
is wide-reaching, demonstra Ɵ ng that our 
community is suppor Ɵ ve of and invested in 
implemen Ɵ ng the Smart City Challenge.
Program Management
Implementa Ɵ on of a comprehensive 
governance framework is cri Ɵ cal to ensuring 
interagency collabora Ɵ on and transparent 
accountability throughout the life of the Smart City Challenge. The City of Rochester will serve as the primary Point of Contact with USDOT for all aspects of the Smart City Challenge. To assist City sta ﬀ  and leadership 
with management responsibili Ɵ es, Stantec 
will provide project management services and technical exper Ɵ se, working closely with 
all project partners to ensure successful implementa Ɵ on of the City’s vision. It is 
anƟ cipated that a Governing Board, chaired 
by the Mayor and consis Ɵ ng of high-
ranking o ﬃ  cials from the many public and 
City of Rochester, NY | 5ROC FORWARD»»»private sector partners, will provide high-
level oversight of the Smart City program. A Technical Council will provide ongoing operaƟ onal management of research and 
technical ac Ɵ viƟ es. The City Engineer will 
chair the Council, assisted by Stantec, with staﬀ -level representa Ɵ on from all project 
partners. The City’s Director of Innova Ɵ on will 
serve as Chief Data Oﬃ   cer for the purposes 
of the Smart City Challenge. Lastly, a Ci Ɵ zens 
Advisory CommiƩ  ee will be established with 
representa Ɵ on from City sta ﬀ , Stantec, and 
the many public advocacy organiza Ɵ ons 
that will help to ensure that the Smart City iniƟ aƟ ves are mee Ɵ ng the needs of the public. 
The Commi Ʃ ee will elect a Chairperson 
from among its members, who will then serve on the Governing Board and appoint a representa Ɵ ve to serve on the Technical 
Council.POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS
Rochester is an ideal candidate for the Smart City Challenge. According to the 2010 Census, Rochester has a popula Ɵ on of 210,565 
represenƟ ng a signi ﬁ cant share of the overall 
populaƟ on (29%) living within the urbanized 
area. The 35.78 square miles of land that comprise the City exhibit a density of 5,884.9 persons per square mile. Rochester is the third-largest city in New York State. It is the seat of Monroe County, which had a 2010 populaƟ on of 744,344. The city is at the center 
of a larger six-county metropolitan area which had a popula Ɵ on of 1,079,671 in 2010. 
Rochester is also a very diverse place. 41.7% of the popula Ɵ on is African American, 37.6% 
is White, 16.4% is Hispanic or La Ɵ no, 3.1% 
is Asian and 1.2% is American Indian, Alaska NaƟ ve or NaƟ ve Hawaiian. Further, recent 
Census data indicates that Rochester has the highest rate of child poverty (50.1%), the highest rate of extreme poverty, and the second-highest rate of poverty overall in the naƟ on. With a diverse popula Ɵ on 
and residents facing economic hardships, successful implementa Ɵ on of Smart City 
elements in Rochester will have broad applicability in ci Ɵ es naƟ onwide.

CHARACTERISTICS
ExisƟ ng TransportaƟ  on 
System
Fixed route bus transit service in the City of Rochester and broader region is provided by the Rochester Genesee Regional Transporta Ɵ on Authority’s Regional Transit 
Service (RTS). RTS currently operates more than 40 routes serving the city and neighboring suburbs. More than 18 million riders uƟ  lized RTS on an annual basis.
Conducive Environment
Rochester is one of America’s most crea Ɵ ve 
communi Ɵ es. We rank among the top 
communi Ɵ es for patents issued per capita as 
well as the percentage of workers in crea Ɵ ve 
industries. The talent pool and our collec Ɵ ve 
capabiliƟ es are well-regarded. In summer 
2015, Rochester was named the home for the new American Ins Ɵ tute for Manufacturing 
Integrated Photonics, a Na Ɵ onal Network 
for Manufacturing Innova Ɵ on (NNMI) 
insƟ tute. It is no surprise that our City is 
well-posiƟ oned to take a lead role among US ciƟ es to demonstrate and deploy advanced 
transporta Ɵ on technologies. 
Leadership Con Ɵ nuity
The City of Rochester is a Strong Mayor-Council government system. In this system, the Mayor possesses wide-ranging administra Ɵ ve 
control over government func Ɵ ons. Mayor 
Lovely A. Warren is in the third year of her ﬁ  rst 
term as Mayor and has already announced her intenƟ on to seek re-elec Ɵ on to a second term. 
The primary sta ﬀ  members are long-term 
municipal employees who possess signi ﬁ cant 
experience with federal projects and programs. At the outset of the program, a succession plan will be developed to ensure con Ɵ nuity should 
leadership or sta ﬀ -level changes take place.
The project will be managed by the City’s Bureau of Architecture & Engineering and overseen by the consultant team at Stantec, a global ﬁ rm with recognized special Ɵ es in 
advanced transporta Ɵ on technology. Stantec’s 
involvement will also ensure con Ɵ nuity 
and conƟ nued focus on successful program 
delivery. 
Sharing Economy
Rochester is home to a strong tradi Ɵ on of 
grassroots community development and alternaƟ ve thinking. The City is currently 
working to support the sharing economy and 
City of Rochester, NY | 7ROC FORWARD»»»alternaƟ ve ownership structures designed 
to develop a more economically inclusive 
community. In the last few years several e ﬀ orts 
have popped up in these areas: 
Market Driven Community Coopera Ɵ ves 
Since 2014, the Mayor’s O ﬃ  ce of Innova Ɵ on 
has been inves Ɵ gaƟ ng the poten Ɵ al for 
economic development strategies centered around worker-owned coopera Ɵ ve businesses. 
These businesses are designed to create entry level employment opportuni Ɵ es in some of 
Rochester’s most distressed neighborhoods.
Democracy Collabora Ɵ ve, a naƟ onal leader in 
community wealth building and worker-owned 
cooperaƟ ve development, recently completed 
a study looking into the feasibility of this strategy in Rochester. Democracy Collabora Ɵ ve 
remains involved with the Evergreen CooperaƟ ves, a successful model in Cleveland, 
Ohio that links new worker-owned businesses to the supply chain needs of local anchor insƟ tuƟ ons like universi Ɵ es and hospitals. 
The study iden Ɵ ﬁ ed signi ﬁ cant local 
anchor interest and six speci ﬁ c business 
opportuni Ɵ es based on market research. 
Democracy Collabora Ɵ ve is recommending 
forming a non-pro ﬁ t holding company to 
provide administra Ɵ ve and human resources 
support to subsidiary for-pro ﬁ t worker-owned 
businesses. The non-pro ﬁ t will also manage a 
revolving loan pool and business development services to help launch new worker-owned businesses. The Mayor and City Council are highly excited about the poten Ɵ al for this 
project, and are funding the next phase of the project to ensure businesses will be operaƟ onal in early 2017. 
Kiva Rochester Chapter - Though Rochester 
has a robust small-business community, many entrepreneurs and would-be business owners face insurmountable ﬁ nancial 
barriers when trying to launch or expand their businesses due to restric Ɵ ve lending 
policies and assessments of risk. Kiva is an internaƟ onal crowdfunding micro ﬁ nance 
insƟ tuƟ on that provides 0% interest loans to 
low-income and underserved entrepreneurs and small businesses. Funding for the loans is secured through internet crowdfunding as well as matching funds from community organizaƟ ons. The loans are issued to quali ﬁ ed 
borrowers following a process that evaluates and establishes creditworthiness. Borrowers undergo an assessment of creditworthiness through a process of social underwri Ɵ ng, 
in which char
acter and strength of support 
networks - as opposed to exclusionary criteria such as FICO scores, collateral, and cash ﬂ ow 
- are used as the best indicators of success. Borrowers pay back the loans to Kiva, who then reissues the funds to other quali ﬁ ed 
borrowers. 
The City is currently working with the 
Rochester Area Community Founda Ɵ on and 
local banks to establish a Rochester Kiva chapter with a $100,000 revolving loan pool that matches internet donors. The program will be launched in summer 2016 with a key Kiva staﬀ  person working with neighborhood 
based organiza Ɵ ons in one of Rochester’s 
underserved neighborhoods. 
RocShare - RocShare is a new organiza Ɵ on, 
founded in 2014, commi Ʃ ed to promo Ɵ ng 
the sharing economy in Rochester. RocShare 
has been inventorying and mapping sharing economy resources. They annually hold Sharefest, a conference showcasing local sharing economy e ﬀ orts, and the FreeMarket, 
an event where donated items are available for new owners. Finally, RocShare has been working to provide policy proposals for how the City might be Ʃ er support the sharing 
economy and associated e ﬀ orts.
Open, Accessible Data
The City is increasing the amount of open data it makes available to the public. In 2012, the City hired its ﬁ rst city-wide GIS coordinator in 
the Department of Informa Ɵ on Technology. 
In 2013, the City launched its ﬁ rst open data 
portal - an interac Ɵ ve mapping interface 
which allows neighborhood groups and ciƟ zens to explore their communi Ɵ es and 
look at data points from crime to property values to compiled census demographics. The data is also available for download for more intensive analysis and comparison. The City looks forward to working with its partners, speciﬁ  cally IBM and RIT, to increase open 
format data sharing with the public.

BEYOND TRAFFIC: 
THE SMART CITY CHALLENGE THE SMART CITY CHALLENGE 
City of Rochester, NY | 9ROC FORWARD»»»OUR APPROACH
Urban AutomaƟ  on
The transporta Ɵ on system of 
the 21st Century Smart City will 
be safe, accessible, equitable, and sustainable. Automated transporta Ɵ on services represent 
the next era of mobility innova Ɵ on. Automated 
transit in par Ɵ cular oﬀ ers an exciƟ  ng 
opportunity to augment and expand exis Ɵ ng 
public transporta Ɵ on services in order to 
beƩ er serve the mobility needs of our city’s 
residents and businesses. Automated transit provides a new soluƟ  on to the ﬁ rst-mile/last-
mile accessibility challenge of exis Ɵ ng ﬁ xed 
route transit services. In partnership with EasyMile and Kodak, we propose to conduct ﬁ eld tesƟ ng and deployment of automated 
transit shu Ʃ les at the 1,200-acre Eastman 
Business Park (EBP) campus, located primarily within the City of Rochester. 
EBP , formerly Kodak Park, is one of the na Ɵ on’s 
largest urban technology campuses. EBP is 
enƟ rely privately-owned and operated, with its 
own streets, railroad, wastewater treatment, ﬁ re protec Ɵ on, and power genera Ɵ on. Over 
6,000 workers are currently employed at EBP . With 2.5M square feet of space and over 300 acres of developable land, there will be signi ﬁ cant growth in the years ahead. 
As such, EBP is a perfect real-world tes Ɵ ng 
and deployment site for automated transit shuƩ les. There are currently six Regional 
Transit Service (RTS) routes which provide access to EBP . However, because public buses do not operate on the campus, it can be challenging for workers to get between the bus stop and their workplace. Automated transit can solve this problem, leading to a greater share of trips being taken by transit.
It is anƟ cipated that deployment at EBP will 
grow over Ɵ me, serving as a dis Ɵ nguishing 
feature that a Ʃ racts jobs and investment 
to this urban campus. Rochester will also 
aggressively pursue opportuni Ɵ es for 
manufacturing and assembly of these automated transit vehicles, poten Ɵ ally creaƟ ng large numbers of high quality jobs in our community. Upon successful tes Ɵ ng at EBP , it is 
anƟ cipated that deployment would transi Ɵ on 
to public streets in the City of Rochester, with early deployment focused on the an Ɵ -poverty 
target area and/or the Downtown Innova Ɵ on 
Zone. The City will work with New York State to enact legisla Ɵ on that facilitates automated 
v
ehicle deployment ini Ɵ ally in Rochester and 
then expanding statewide.
Connected Shared Automated Vehicle (CSAV) Shu Ʃ les
Over the past few years there has been signiﬁ cant research and demonstra Ɵ on of 
various AV products. Companies such as Google and automobile manufacturers have been tesƟ ng their AVs with impressive results 
for a number of Ready-to-Market (RTM) products such as CSAV shu Ʃ les. More work 
is needed to re ﬁ ne the technology, but the 
pace of progress has accelerated. There is growing public awareness that the use of AVs by the public is a ma Ʃ er of when and not if. 
In fact, starƟ  ng in 2016 many demonstra Ɵ on 
projects will begin to gradually transi Ɵ on 
to public streets across the globe. We want Rochester to take a lead role. Large companies and start-ups are inves Ɵ ng billions of dollars 
in the research and development of AV technologies in combina Ɵ on with innova Ɵ ve 
business models such as Uber and on-demand transit. Over Ɵ  me, this will result in a massive 
transforma Ɵ on of the mobility landscape with 
signiﬁ cant societal implica Ɵ ons. Safety is the 
single most important bene ﬁ t associated with 
AVs given that over 90% of tra ﬃ  c incidents are 
caused by human error. 
City of Rochester, NY | 10ROC FORWARD»»»A natural extension of AV technology is into 
the sphere of public transporta Ɵ on. More 
speciﬁ  cally, the applica Ɵ on of electric CSAV 
shuƩ les for complemen Ɵ ng and integra Ɵ ng 
with tradi Ɵ onal modes of transit. This has 
been in the demonstra Ɵ on phase in Europe 
for the CityMobil2 ini Ɵ aƟ ve (see image below) 
during the past ﬁ ve years and holds great 
promise in addressing the challenges faced by transit operators. Today these agencies face growing public frustra Ɵ on with inadequate 
parking at major transit centers and lack of reliable connec Ɵ ons, which nega Ɵ vely impact 
ridership targets. 
 
CSAV shu Ʃ les can also address mobility 
requirements in urban se ƫ  ngs such as college 
campuses and large residen Ɵ al developments. 
For example, city residents may face daily challenges ﬁ nding parking spaces for inter-
city trips and/or access to and from transit staƟ ons. CSAV shu Ʃ les can address these 
challenges in a very e ﬃ  cient, reliable, safe, 
and friendly manner. They can be especially eﬀ ecƟ ve in areas not served by tradi Ɵ onal 
bus or mass transit and can help connect those centers with transporta Ɵ on hubs. 
Furthermore, CSAV shu Ʃ les can serve as 
new modes of transit with dynamic rou Ɵ ng 
- in essence combining the best features of ridesharing services with tradi Ɵ onal 
ﬁ xed-route opera Ɵ ons. CSAV will allow 
impoverished ci Ɵ zens get to their jobs. 
Depending on speci ﬁ c CSAV shu Ʃ le 
implementa Ɵ on scenarios (urban centers or ﬁ rst/last-mile) some infrastructure prepara Ɵ on 
may be required. For example, CSAV shu Ʃ les 
can share space with bicycles in a downtown ar
ea with dedicated curb-side bicycle lanes. 
In other cases, such as connec Ɵ ng major 
transit hubs to parking areas, Hard Shoulder Running (HSR) strategies can be deployed to accommodate higher speed CSAV shu Ʃ les. 
The Rochester se ƫ  ng and number of college 
campuses and business parks presents mulƟ ple opportuni Ɵ es for synergis Ɵ c 
applicaƟ on of CSAV shu Ʃ les during peak hours. 
Keys to success of CSAV shu Ʃ les are:
 »Technology tes Ɵ ng and prototype 
development (ongoing)
 »Appropriate regulatory frameworks for operaƟ ons under reduced speeds for 
safe and e ﬃ  cient early deployment (in 
development)
 »IdenƟ ﬁ caƟ on of sites with demonstrated 
transit need, demand, and infrastructure integraƟ on
 »OperaƟ onal exper Ɵ se to ensure e ﬃ  cient 
and reliable services
 »Improved “backbone transit” such as BRT, connecƟ  on buses, or shu Ʃ le buses to 
improve travel Ɵ me and reliability
CSAV shu Ʃ les can operate at low speeds 
(25mph) and can be integrated with dedicated bicycle lanes that are increasing in Rochester and ciƟ es across North America. This 
approach will help to accelerate CSAV shu Ʃ le 
adopƟ on, enhance transit system ridership, 
and contribute to modal shi Ō  and the overall 
opƟ mizaƟ on of our transporta Ɵ on network in 
Rochester. 
Complemen Ɵ ng Mass Transit
The CityMobil2 Ini Ɵ aƟ ve 
City of Rochester, NY | 11ROC FORWARD»»»Connected Vehicles
Rochester is an older, fully built-
out city with minimal opportunity to physically grow. In fact, the City has aggressively pursued a 
program of “right-sizing” streets to be Ʃ er 
meet the needs of today’s popula Ɵ on. In the 
past, the primary focus of street design was on wider roads and faster moving car tra ﬃ  c. 
Today the goal is to accommodate cars while maximizing space for other users, namely bicyclists, pedestrians, and transit users. To conƟ  nue this approach in the face of rising 
demand now and in the future, it is cri Ɵ cal 
to maximize the e ﬃ  ciency of the exis Ɵ ng 
transporta Ɵ on system. 
Connected vehicle technology provides previously unimaginable opportuni Ɵ es 
to beƩ er manage the system by greatly 
enhancing tra ﬃ  c safety, monitoring and 
responding to tra ﬃ  c condiƟ ons in real- Ɵ me, 
opƟ mizing emergency response and public 
transporta Ɵ on services, among many other 
bene ﬁ ts. Connected vehicle technology will 
allow ciƟ es to meet demand, improve service, 
and reduce costs. To that end, the City of Rochester proposes to partner with GE to deploy their Current® technology on the City street system.
Current takes advantage of the exis Ɵ ng street 
lighƟ ng system to deploy a network of sensors, 
transmiƩ  ers, and microprocessors that can 
communicate with vehicles. This technological 
advancement oﬀ  ers a myriad of possibili Ɵ es, 
such as advising drivers of unexpected hazards or upcoming tra ﬃ  c conges Ɵ on and sugges Ɵ ng 
alternate routes, or warning a wrong-way driver entering the expressway system while simultaneously no Ɵ fying authori Ɵ es and the 
traveling public.
The City will also partner with Mobileye 
to deploy their Shield+ collision avoidance technology on both the RTS bus ﬂ eet as well 
as on the City’s ﬂ eet of nearly 500 public 
works vehicles. This will greatly enhance safety for bicyclists and pedestrians on city streets while providing be Ʃ er travel Ɵ me reliability 
and service delivery to our residents and businesses.Intelligent, Sensor-Based 
Infrastructure
A Smart City is able to collect 
and analyze data to inform the public, measure performance, and opƟ mize investment 
decision-making. In the absence of a robust network of sensors, 
collecƟ ng reliable data and providing real- Ɵ me 
informaƟ on is a signi ﬁ cant challenge. Through 
our proposed partnership with GE, sensors will be ubiquitous throughout the city, enabling City government to collect a wide range of data, including mul Ɵ -modal tra ﬃ  c volumes 
and speeds, pavement condi Ɵ on, weather 
informaƟ on, ambient air quality data, parking 
availability, and motor vehicle crashes. The City will work in partnership with RIT and IBM to determine how best to integrate this new data collecƟ on capability with exis Ɵ ng data in order 
to improve customer service, manage costs, and improve government accountability.
Like many other ciƟ  es across USA, Rochester’s 
roadway infrastructures, including pavements, 
bridges, and signs, are deteriora Ɵ ng rapidly 
due to material aging, improper usage, harsh environments, and natural and man-made damages. With the advancement of sensor technologies, it becomes feasible to collect the large-scale, in- ﬁ eld, and detailed infrastructure 
data, such as 3D pavement surface data, using high-performance cameras, lasers, LiDARs, and InerƟ al Naviga Ɵ on System (INS). This allows 
for beƩ er insight and understanding of large-
scale in- ﬁ eld infrastructure behavior. We will 
build a framework for the sensor-based and spaƟ ally-enabled next genera Ɵ on intelligent, 
sustainable infrastructure management system, including the key components of data acquisiƟ on, automa Ɵ c informa Ɵ on extracƟ  on, 
data integra Ɵ on, and intelligent infrastructure 
management with assistance from our partners, IBM and GE.
City of Rochester, NY | 12ROC FORWARD»»»Urban Analy Ɵ cs
A wealth of new data will be 
generated through the many iniƟ aƟ ves of our Smart City vision, 
complemen Ɵ ng a growing supply 
of data that is already available. Our industry partners at IBM are 
recognized global leaders in analy Ɵ cs, with 
unmatched experƟ  se in working with agencies 
and organiza Ɵ ons around the world to solve 
problems using the power of informa Ɵ on. IBM 
will work in tandem with an interdepartmental research team at RIT, in conjuncƟ  on with 
the City and non-pro ﬁ t community partners 
such as Reconnect Rochester and the Center for Disability Rights, to develop informa Ɵ on 
sharing pla ƞ orms, smart mobile applica Ɵ ons, 
and other techniques to address a wide variety of issues ranging from Transporta Ɵ on Demand 
Management in the downtown area to city-wide universal access and design and goods movement.
User-focused Mobility 
Services and Choices
A criƟ  cal component in enhancing 
mobility for travelers is to give 
them beƩ er informa Ɵ on that can 
be used to make smart decisions about their trip. Through our partnership with Xerox and other 
partners, the City will develop a leading edge applica Ɵ on for real- Ɵ me transporta Ɵ on 
informaƟ on to enable be Ʃ er decision-making 
with respect to travel op Ɵ ons and integrated 
payment for those op Ɵ ons, advancing the 
“Mobility on Demand” concept and facilita Ɵ ng 
more of our residents to choose car-free or car-light lifestyles. Interoperable, mobile fare payment combining a wide variety of travel opƟ ons (transit, rideshare, carshare, bikeshare, 
taxi, parking, etc.) is the goal and equitable access for un-banked residents without access to credit is a primary considera Ɵ on. 
Parking management is another important factor for the City. Parking can impact congesƟ on, aﬀ ect safety, and impede 
access. Determining occupancy is the key to understanding demand and se ƫ  ng the appropriate metered parking prices. When hourly parking meter prices don’t keep up with demand, the search for parking becomes painful. That search creates conges Ɵ on and 
dangerous condi Ɵ ons as frustrated motorists 
circle for parking. While there’s a municipal impact on revenue, the real weight of these policy decisions rests squarely on the backs of customers, people like motorists, merchants, bicyclists, pedestrians, and other stakeholders.
Xerox’s Merge® pla ƞ orm will provide a means 
of managing parking opera Ɵ ons with a central 
management solu Ɵ on. Merge® fully integrates 
and provides analy Ɵ cs on all aspects of 
metered and oﬀ  -street programs. The system 
integrates hardware and soŌ  ware to provide 
real-Ɵ  me informa Ɵ on about coin collec Ɵ ons, 
meter maintenance, enforcement, and 
occupancy by applying real- Ɵ me data to solve 
parking and mobility issues.
Our goal is to be inclusive with all ci Ɵ zens. 
Therefore, we have engaged representa Ɵ ves 
of the Center for Disability Rights, Inc. (CDR), a 
not-for-pro ﬁ t, community-based advocacy and 
service organiza Ɵ on for people with all types 
of disabili Ɵ es, including over 10,000 disabled 
adults aged 20-64 living in poverty. CDR has already provided a number of important insights regarding our transporta Ɵ on system of 
today and tomorrow, including:
»Univ
ersal design should be used 
throughout any transporta Ɵ on plan to 
ensure we don’t have any segregated transporta Ɵ on for people with disabili Ɵ es.
»For communica Ɵ on, emphasis should 
be put on text communica Ɵ on either via 
a texƟ ng or a web-based pla ƞ orm, like 
TwiƩ er. This will help to target the younger 
populaƟ on as well as the Deaf Community. 
»All web-based site or applica Ɵ ons should 
be screen-reader friendly to ensure the Blind popula Ɵ on has access to the 
informaƟ on.
»A mobile applica Ɵ on that iden Ɵ ﬁ es the 
accessible entrance on buildings is needed to help with transporta Ɵ on coordina Ɵ on. 
This would allow a person to choose to get oﬀ  at a bus stop closest to that entrance or 
plan another accessible path of travel. 
City of Rochester, NY | 13ROC FORWARD»»»Urban Delivery and 
LogisƟ cs
The Rochester team has included 
Verdant Global to help transform Rochester into a truly sustainable Smart City. Their patented 
technology enables them to produce fresh, consistent, insec Ɵ cide-free produce year 
round. Their business model uses exis Ɵ ng 
vacant structures and repurposes them to operate fully automated AgriFactories for local consump Ɵ on. The City will partner with 
Verdant Global to establish a highly-e ﬃ  cient, 
automated AgriFactory at an exis Ɵ ng vacant 
warehouse in the City of Rochester. This will eliminate many long-haul delivery trucks from our busy streets and highways and greatly reduce GHG emissions. Its fully automated system lends itself to local distribu Ɵ on via 
connected and/or automated vehicles, just-in-Ɵ me delivery techniques, and use of analy Ɵ cs 
to minimize con ﬂ icts between delivery and 
traﬃ  c needs on city streets.
It will also provide much needed purpose for vacant and abandoned buildings, thereby invigoraƟ ng distressed neighborhoods 
and proper Ɵ es. It may also lead to direct 
employment, provide passive surveillance, create a new tax base, and poten Ɵ ally 
sƟ mulate other economic and business 
acƟ vity. Through their business case speci ﬁ cs, 
the opportunity may exist to give back new sources of regional funding that can then be reinvested in the community through new community services, community centers and other social investments. We believe this can ulƟ mately lead to a reducƟ  on in poverty in the 
very neighborhoods these ini Ɵ aƟ ves occur.
Strategic Business Models 
& Partnering
The City of Rochester is a ﬁ rm 
believer in entrepreneurial 
government. This is evidenced by the establishment of the O ﬃ  ce 
of Innova Ɵ on & Strategic Ini Ɵ aƟ ves and the 
support it has received through Bloomberg Philanthropies and IBM’s Smarter Ci Ɵ es IniƟ aƟ ve to develop innova Ɵ ve soluƟ ons for 
reducing poverty in our community. The City brings this same approach to the Smart City Challenge. As detailed in Sec Ɵ on 7, the City has 
assembled a dynamic and broad consor Ɵ um 
of partners across all levels of government, academia, business, and community. These partners are commi Ʃ ed to making Rochester 
the successful Smart City that will serve as a model for using technological innova Ɵ on to 
improve safety, enhance mobility, and protect the environment while also expanding equity and aƩ acking urban poverty. Upon no Ɵ ﬁ caƟ on 
of our selec Ɵ on as a Smart City Finalist, the 
City of Rochester will work with its partners to further de ﬁ ne roles and responsibili Ɵ es, and 
terms of reference, for each func Ɵ onal body.
The City of Rochester is partnering with RIT, a comprehensive na Ɵ onal research university 
with nearly 19,000 students. RIT is a member (sub-grantee) of the Region 2 University Transporta Ɵ on Center (UTC) consor Ɵ um whose 
strategic goal is economic compe Ɵ Ɵ veness. 
This partnership will allow the City to leverage the intellectual capacity of both RIT and the UTC as a whole.
It is anƟ cipated that opportuni Ɵ es for cost-
sharing and in-kind service delivery will be 
made available. The ability to leverage the federal resources provided through the Smart City Challenge to a Ʃ ract addi Ɵ onal ﬁ nancial 
and technical assistance will help to ensure that Rochester’s Smart City vision produces a real and long-las Ɵ ng impact on Rochester, New 
York State, and the na Ɵ on as a whole.
Smart Grid, Roadway 
Electri ﬁ caƟ on, & Electric 
Vehicles
The Oﬃ   ce of Electricity Delivery 
& Energy Reliability (OE) has 
taken on a na Ɵ onal leadership 
role to modernize the na Ɵ on’s 
electricity delivery system. A 
Policy Framework for the 21st Century Grid describes four goals to be pursued to ensure that all Americans bene ﬁ t from investment 
in the NaƟ on’s electric infrastructure: be Ʃ er 
City of Rochester, NY | 14ROC FORWARD»»»alignment of economic incen Ɵ ves to boost 
development and deployment of smart-grid 
technologies; a greater focus on standards and interoperability to enable greater innova Ɵ on; 
empowerment of consumers with enhanced informaƟ on to save energy, ensure privacy, 
and shrink bills; and improve grid security and resilience. 
OE has established seven principal smart grid 
funcƟ onal characteris Ɵ cs:
 »Self-healing from power disturbance events
 »Enabling ac Ɵ ve parƟ cipaƟ on by consumers 
in demand response
 »OperaƟ ng resiliently against physical and 
cyber aƩ ack
 »Providing power quality for 21st century needs
 »Accommoda Ɵ ng all genera Ɵ on and storage 
opƟ ons
 »Enabling new products, services and markets
 »OpƟ mizing assets and opera Ɵ ng eﬃ  ciently
By focusing on Eastman Business Park as a potenƟ al private pilot campus, the ability to 
analyze each of these func Ɵ onal characteris Ɵ cs 
in a seƫ  ng that is transferrable to a public 
porƟ on of the City becomes possible.
As part of an exis Ɵ ng program, the City 
is partnering with Energe Ɵ cs and the 
Electriﬁ  caƟ on CoaliƟ on to grow the Electric 
Vehicle (EV) ecosystem in Rochester and in so doing, expand the market for EVs. EV Charging Sta Ɵ on Plans for the ﬁ ve regions 
along the I-90 Corridor (Capital District, Mohawk Valley, Central New York, Genesee Valley/Finger Lakes, and Western New York) will be implemented, spurring EV acceptance and adop Ɵ on. The outcome will be: 1) 
25 EV charging sta Ɵ 
 ons (5 in each region) 
strategically installed in cri Ɵ cal areas to enable 
greater EV use, 2) educated municipali Ɵ es 
on EV charging sta Ɵ on permi ƫ  ng and 
communi Ɵ es on EV technology, 3) 900 rebates 
for EV purchases to spur EV sales and establish more EV advocates (the new EV owners), and 4) 40 ride-n-drive events to promote EVs and allow consumers a test drive opportunity of diﬀ erent makes and models in a single 
locaƟ on.The Rochester EV Deployment Community will also foster a model EV Community in which EVs are embraced by the public and promoted by business and government. This approach moves EVs from a niche product into a dominant and ubiquitous concept. The outcomes will be: 1) 9 EV charging sta Ɵ ons in 
City of Rochester garages for public and city-owned EVs, 2) EVs for the City of Rochester as an ambassador of the technology and to showcase their opera Ɵ on, and 3) an 
extensive community engagement to inform and educate the residents and businesses throughout the City about the bene ﬁ ts of EVs. 
The Rochester EV Deployment Community will create replicable models for other New York communi Ɵ es to use for accelera Ɵ ng EV 
adopƟ on.

City of Rochester, NY | 15ROC FORWARD»»»Connected, Involved 
CiƟ zens
Our ciƟ zens are going to determine 
if any measures proposed to 
address the Smart City Challenge are indeed a success. Fortunately, we have a number of strong, ciƟ  zen 
lead organiza Ɵ ons that currently provide input 
on transporta Ɵ on related issues. Three such 
organizaƟ ons are: Rochester Cycling Alliance, 
Reconnect Rochester, and Community Design Center Rochester. Through educa Ɵ on and 
outreach, each of these groups help create a broad base of support for our exis Ɵ ng 
public transit system, shape regional policies to improve the system, and reconnect our community in ways that improve personal mobility, urban vitality, environmental sustainability, and economic development. We would look to these groups, as well as other City and ci Ɵ zen-lead organiza Ɵ ons, to 
be partners in all phases of the Smart City Challenge.
We will be reaching out to ci Ɵ zens that are not 
currently engaged through the use of the City’s 
website, television and radio, public outreach meeƟ ngs, and social media. Social media will be especially useful in broadening public awareness of the ini Ɵ aƟ ves 
that will be undertaken. We will meet people where they expect to be met in this day and age where 85% of American adults use the internet and 91% of adults have a cell phone. We want to engage a wide range of people during the process and the best way to reach an audience more inclined to use new technology is through social media. 
Architecture & Standards
Given the amount of data that will be collected from a variety of partners, a robust system of integrated funcƟ  onality supported 
by a common, shared database is a must. The City of Rochester currently employs ITS systems for transporta Ɵ on data collec Ɵ on. As 
described in the IBM Smarter Ci Ɵ es Challenge 
Report, a solu Ɵ on based system will need to 
incorporate the following:
»Person-centric applica Ɵ ons
»Mobility
»Master data management
»Content management systems
»System interfaces
»Data security
»Role-based user access
City of Rochester, NY | 16ROC FORWARD»»»»Audit-tracking and repor Ɵ ng
»Data warehousing
»OperaƟ onal repor Ɵ ng
»AnalyƟ cs and predic Ɵ ve analyƟ cs
»Document management
»Disaster recovery and performance
As an on-going task within the Smart City 
Challenge, an evalua Ɵ on will be made of 
these system components to determine if the exisƟ ng ITS system requires upda Ɵ ng. If new 
standards are needed, recommenda Ɵ ons will 
be provided to USDOT and the Connected Vehicle Reference Implementa Ɵ on (CVRIA) to 
the extent possible. 
Using the CVRIA, we will determine the roles, 
processes, data ﬂ  ows, physical components, 
and communica Ɵ on protocols necessary for 
privacy and security opera Ɵ ons using the 
SCMS prototype. We will concurrently use the Systems Engineering Tool for Intelligent Transporta Ɵ on (SET-IT) to complete the project 
architecture of diagrams and de ﬁ niƟ ons of all 
layers and func Ɵ onal components along with 
an inclusive Privacy and Security Management OperaƟ onal Concept, aligning requirements to 
necessary aspects of the CVRIA. Our program management consultant, Stantec, will iden Ɵ fy 
the needs, stakeholders, systems, and Smart City Connected Vehicle applica Ɵ ons that will 
make up our deployment program. We will enter the informa Ɵ on gathered into the SET-IT 
soŌ ware and tailor each applica Ɵ on at layer 
2 in the physical and enterprise views. We will then tailor the layer 1 and layer 0 physical diagrams as well as the layer 0 enterprise diagrams in prepara Ɵ on for presenta Ɵ on of 
the project architecture to the stakeholder review panel. We will generate the Concept of OperaƟ ons from the SET-IT so Ō ware and 
provide support and/or develop the remaining secƟ ons of the Concept of Opera Ɵ ons not 
detailed in the generated document. InformaƟ  on & 
Communica Ɵ ons Technology
In Rochester, like many other ciƟ es, our exis Ɵ ng Informa Ɵ on and 
Communica Ɵ on Technology (ICT) 
infrastructure is lacking capital investment due to our resurgence 
from the recessionary era of past decade. The Smart City Concept will allow us to re-evaluate our ICT infrastructure and build a robust, eﬃ  cient, secure and resilient ICT to lower 
our consump Ɵ on while building a redundant 
hi-bird communica Ɵ on system. Through our 
partnership with IBM and GE, we will focus on Green Networking as the way to help reduce carbon emissions by the ICT industry. The Smart City Challenge will present us with opportunity to implement our City’s green networking vision by selec Ɵ ng energy-e ﬃ  cient 
networking technologies and products, and minimize resource use whenever possible. Our ICT green networking prac Ɵ ce will include: 
implemen Ɵ ng virtualiza Ɵ on; pracƟ  cing server 
consolida Ɵ on; relying on cloud compu Ɵ ng; 
upgrading older equipment for newer, more energy-eﬃ  cient product; employing system 
management to increase e ﬃ  ciency; and 
promoƟ  ng telecommuƟ  ng. Our vision is to 
lower consump Ɵ on by 25% by 2025 and we 
will leverage mostly private sector capital investment by providing mulƟ  -year incen Ɵ ves 
in sharing cost reduc Ɵ on revenue. 
We will develop security requirements for the DSRC devices that we expect to deploy in Rochester. We will follow the Common Criteria methodology, an ISO standard, to complete an analysis of needs and develop recommenda Ɵ ons for a security standard. 
The methodology includes analyzing threats, assumpƟ ons, policies, objec Ɵ ves, and 
developing security func Ɵ onal requirements 
to miƟ gate threats and ensure con ﬁ denƟ ality, 
availability, integrity, authen Ɵ city, and non-
repudiaƟ on of transmi Ʃ ed data for ICT. We 
will compare our analysis against similar domesƟ c and interna Ɵ onal eﬀ orts to ensure a 
comprehensive assessment of security needs. Our team expects to leverage our exis Ɵ ng 
analyses and update use cases, measures, 
and requirements, with an overall system 
City of Rochester, NY | 17ROC FORWARD»»»implementa Ɵ on and applica Ɵ on deployment 
viewpoint, to develop and execute an e ﬀ ecƟ ve 
security management opera Ɵ onal strategy. 
Our partners at Stantec have extensive 
experience with the current SCMS design through their close working rela Ɵ onship 
with USDOT and its partners as they have developed the fundamental security system (SCMS) for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to infrastructure (V2I) safety systems and applica Ɵ ons. Our team will leverage the 
experƟ se in this domain to determine which 
requirements can be ful ﬁ lled based on the 
prototype SCMS and align these requirements to each SCMS func Ɵ onal component. Using 
the CVRIA, we will determine the roles, processes, data ﬂ  ows, physical components, 
and communica Ɵ ons protocols necessary for 
privacy and security opera Ɵ ons uƟ lizing the 
SCMS prototype. The team will concurrently use the SET-IT to complete project architecture of diagrams and de ﬁ niƟ ons at all layers 
and funcƟ onal components along with an 
inclusive Privacy and Security Management OperaƟ onal Concept aligning requirements to 
necessary aspects of the CVRIA. The Security Management Opera Ɵ onal Concept will 
include clear direc Ɵ on on how to approach 
ensuring physical security at the vehicle and roadside infrastructure level. Several current hardware security standards exist for ensuring against tampering of physical devices, many of which may be applicable to DSRC devices integrated or added on to vehicles. In addi Ɵ on, maintaining strong 
internal organiza Ɵ onal controls, whether 
at the technical, legal, administra Ɵ ve, or 
personnel levels should be developed and included in this Concept in order to provide as robust a security environment as possible. We have already conducted research and analysis into these areas of control, and will bring its understanding to development of the deployment plan. Tools to monitor, measure, and track security elements at all levels of the Smart City system will also be speci ﬁ ed in the 
Security Management Opera Ɵ onal Concept.Smart Land Use
The story of poverty in Rochester is one fueled by disinvestment and depopula Ɵ on. The City lost 
24% of its popula Ɵ on between 
1970 and 2010, and increased its 
poverty rate by 18% over the same Ɵ meframe. 
These ﬁ  gures are even more drama Ɵ c in high 
poverty areas, with those who are able moving away from issues of crime and disinvestment towards safety and economic opportunity. Neighborhoods like Marketview Heights have had more than 20% of their homes demolished due to vacancy and blight. According to Census LODES Origin Des Ɵ naƟ on Data, less than 5% 
of employed residents in neighborhoods like Marketview Heights hold jobs in their neighborhood, and over 50% of those employed are making long daily commutes to low skill jobs in the suburbs. Over 50% of the jobs located in the neighborhoods are held by suburban commuters. This seemingly illogical reverse commute is one of the hallmarks of the decline of these neighborhoods and the macro-economic forces driving this transforma Ɵ on. 
To address this challenge, key recommenda Ɵ ons of both the Rochester-
Monroe An Ɵ -Poverty Ini Ɵ aƟ ve (RMAPI) 
and the IBM Smarter Ci Ɵ es IniƟ aƟ ve relate 
to Smart Land Use. Speci ﬁ cally, RMAPI 
recommends the purposeful development of ‘Complete Communi Ɵ es’ while IBM 
recommends establishment of ‘Urban Villages.’ Both recommenda Ɵ ons focus on the 
creaƟ on of dense, mixed-use development

retail and services, employment, health care, educaƟ onal facili Ɵ es and other services that 
are well served by an integrated, mul Ɵ -modal 
transporta Ɵ on network, minimizing the need 
for private car use. The City will work with its Smart City partners to advance these recommenda Ɵ ons.
The City of Rochester Zoning Code provides us with a strong founda Ɵ on. The Code 
recognizes, promotes, and protects a dense, walkable, and mixed-use urban character that is sustainable and cri Ɵ cal to a Smart 
City. The Code breaks away from tradi Ɵ onal 
zoning which usually a Ʃ empts to separate 
uses and o Ō en defers to vehicle-oriented site 
development. Commercial Districts and Village Center Districts provide for a dense mixture of uses such as housing, retail and other complementary uses that serve the adjacent neighborhoods and the community at large. Design standards that create, enhance, and reinforce the design rela Ɵ onships between 
buildings, sites, and streets establish an ambiance that is dense and pedestrian-oriented. The Zoning Code is evolving and will conƟ nue to respond to the need for 
sustainable redevelopment in Rochester that protects the City’s uniquely urban character.The City is in the process of upda Ɵ ng its 
Comprehensive Plan, which currently dates from 1999. A key component of the Comprehensive Plan Update is the upcoming Comprehensive Access & Mobility Plan, the transporta Ɵ on component of the Plan. The 
update process has begun and will take place concurrent with the Ɵ meline of the Smart City 
Challenge, providing a unique opportunity for the various Smart City ini Ɵ aƟ ves to inform the 
Comprehensive Plan, which will guide land use and development policy and decision-making in Rochester for the foreseeable future.

Partners
The City of Rochester, under the leadership 
of Mayor Lovely Warren and with assistance from our commi Ʃ ed consor Ɵ um of partners, 
is well structured and organized to accomplish this mission. The City has consistently taken a leadership role in transporta Ɵ on and 
believes the future economic vitality of the region depends on the ability to provide safe, reliable, and e ﬃ  cient mobility through 
the transporta Ɵ on network. It is clear that 
in the 21st Century we will not be able to be compeƟ Ɵ ve economically without smarter 
transporta Ɵ on networks that provide improved 
transit accessibility to our underserved populaƟ on. We must provide an e ﬃ  cient 
transporta Ɵ on system by using the latest 
development in Connected Shared Automated Vehicles (CSAV) applica Ɵ ons, tesƟ ng emerging 
technologies, and leveraging partnerships with the private sector. Examples are EasyMile, an interna Ɵ onal ﬁ rm that is considering 
opportuni Ɵ es to establish a manufacturing 
facility in Rochester, and other tech giants such as GE, IBM, Xerox and Kodak. 
The City of Rochester, in collabora Ɵ on with 
the public sector agencies, private sector 
businesses, ins Ɵ tuƟ ons, public advocacy, and 
non-pro ﬁ ts, is fully commi Ʃ ed to ROC Forward, 
Rochester’s Smart City vision. If selected, Rochester will successfully establish itself as the model Smart City for the na Ɵ on. 
Governance Processes
Implementa Ɵ on of a comprehensive 
governance framework is cri Ɵ cal to ensuring 
interagency collabora Ɵ on and transparent 
accountability throughout the life of the Smart City Challenge. The City of Rochester will serve as the primary Point of Contact with USDOT for all aspects of the Smart City Challenge. To assist City sta ﬀ  and leadership 
with management responsibili Ɵ es, Stantec 
will provide project management services and technical exper Ɵ se, working closely with

Partnerships
As referenced above, the City of Rochester has assembled an impressive and wide-ranging consorƟ um of public agencies, ins Ɵ tuƟ ons 
of higher learning, leading edge private sector businesses, and public advocacy organizaƟ ons. Our primary academic partner 
is RIT, a University Transporta Ɵ on Center 
(UTC) consor Ɵ um member with signi ﬁ cant 
and growing experience in transporta Ɵ on 
research. RIT will coordinate research ac Ɵ viƟ es 
associated with Rochester’s Smart City vision, thereby establishing long-las Ɵ ng partnerships 
with the public and private sector. Our many world class private sector partners will work with the City to deploy their innova Ɵ ve 
advanced transporta Ɵ on technologies, while 
demonstra Ɵ ng proof of concept and leading 
to commercializa Ɵ on that will grow the 
naƟ onal economy and posi Ɵ on America as a 
global leader in these emerging ﬁ elds. These 
companies include: EasyMile, GE, Xerox, IBM, Kodak, and Verdant Global. We an Ɵ cipate 
addiƟ onal public-private partnerships to 
emerge as Rochester moves ahead as the selected city. Our public agency partners involve all levels of government: State (New York State Department of Transporta Ɵ on, the 
Safety & Security Planning & Development Bureau, and Empire State Development), County (Monroe County), and regional (RTS, GTC).
OUR SYSTEM
Arterial Miles
There are 103.96 centerline miles of arterial streets in the City of Rochester.  The vast majority of these streets are within the City’s jurisdicƟ on.
Freeway Miles
There are 14.95 centerline miles of freeway in the City of Rochester, all under the jurisdic Ɵ on 
of New York State.
Transit Services
Rochester Transit Service (RTS) currently operates more than 41 routes serving the city and neighboring suburbs. More than 17 million riders u Ɵ lized RTS in 2013. The $40 
million RTS Transit Center opened to the public in November 2014. The Transit Center created a centralized, indoor transfer point for bus patrons at the heart of the Downtown InnovaƟ on Zone.
RTS also provides paratransit service for over 175,000 riders in accordance with the Americans with Disabili Ɵ es Act (ADA) to 
cerƟ ﬁ ed customers with limited mobility.  
GTC is currently developing an update to the Public Transporta Ɵ on Human Service 
Coordinated Plan. As part of that e ﬀ ort, GTC 
conducted analyses in support of the USDOT’s Ladders of Opportuni Ɵ es iniƟ aƟ ve. One of 
the analyses included mapping the loca Ɵ on 
of low- and middle-skills jobs in rela Ɵ on to 
concentra Ɵ ons of poverty and ﬁ  xed route 
bus service. This is shown on the map on the following page. 
City of Rochester, NY | 21ROC FORWARD»»»Shared-Use Mobility 
Services
Carsharing services in the City of Rochester 
are currently o ﬀ ered through Zipcar. There are 
currently eight Zipcars available in the City and another two vehicles just south of the city at RIT. Zipcar and the City are working together to grow the availability of carshare services in the city. Zipcar is a partner in our Smart City vision. Although bikesharing is not currently available in Rochester, the City an Ɵ cipates an 
iniƟ al rollout as soon as summer 2016. Zagster, 
a bikeshare service provider, is a partner in our Smart City vision. Ridesharing services such as Uber and Ly Ō  are not currently able to operate 
in New York State, outside of New York City. The City of Rochester is suppor Ɵ ve of pending 
legislaƟ on in Albany to permit ridesharing 
services to operate statewide. The City anƟ cipates this legisla Ɵ on will be approved in 
2016. 
GTC is the sponsor of roceasyride, a free, 
easy-to-use online trip planning tool that helps people iden Ɵ fy opƟ ons to save money and 
protect the environment by riding the bus, carpooling, and bicycling. It includes features that make it easy to track the cost savings and the environmental bene ﬁ ts that result.

There is an extensive municipal ﬁ ber network 
within the City of Rochester that possesses 
excess capacity. The City and Monroe County are working together to take advantage of this resource, with par Ɵ cular interest in 
considering a municipal wi- ﬁ  network. This 
ﬁ ber backbone is a signi ﬁ cant advantage 
for the deployment of Smart City Challenge elements. 
Intelligent Transporta Ɵ on 
Systems
The Greater Rochester area is a recognized naƟ onal leader in regional coordina Ɵ on 
for Intelligent Transporta Ɵ on Systems 
(ITS) implementa Ɵ on. GTC facilitates a 
Transporta Ɵ on Management Commi Ʃ ee 
(TMC) that provides a forum for regional cooperaƟ on on ITS and opera Ɵ ons issues. 
The City of Rochester is an ac Ɵ ve parƟ cipant 
on the TMC and rou Ɵ nely collaborates with 
Monroe County Department of Transporta Ɵ on, 
which serves as the City’s tra ﬃ  c engineer, and 
NYSDOT. On the strength of this and other iniƟ aƟ ves, regional agencies have deployed 
hundreds of ITS ﬁ eld devices as well as central 
control and communica Ɵ ons infrastructure 
impacƟ ng every mode of transporta Ɵ on in 
the region. As the facilitator of the TMC, GTC serves as the “gatekeeper” of the federally-mandated Regional ITS Architecture and works with all stakeholders to ensure relevant ITS elements and processes are consistent with the Regional ITS Architecture.
A forthcoming endeavor of GTC, with oversight 
of the TMC, is a Transporta Ɵ on System 
Management and Opera Ɵ ons (TSMO) Strategic 
Plan to update the exis Ɵ ng ITS Strategic 
Plan that was adopted in 2011. The TSMO Strategic Plan will look at all exis Ɵ ng and 
planned ITS elements and lay the groundwork for the implementa Ɵ on of connected and 
autonomous vehicles in the region.Smart Grid
In partnership with Energe Ɵ cs and the 
Electriﬁ  caƟ on CoaliƟ on, the City is currently 
assisƟ ng with development of the Electric 
Vehicle (EV) Market Development Program using funding from the New York State Energy Research & Development Authority’s Cleaner Greener CommuniƟ  es Program. The 
goal of this market development program is to sƟ mulate and expand the market for EV 
purchases. It uses a three-pronged approach of installing EV charging sta Ɵ ons, oﬀ ering 
EV incenƟ ves, and conduc Ɵ ng outreach. 
It leverages and builds on prior NYSERDA sponsored projects and EV ini Ɵ aƟ ves, including 
EV-readiness resources, ChargeNY website, regional EV charging sta Ɵ on plans, City of 
Rochester’s EVSE demonstra Ɵ on project, and 
EV tourism study for Mid-Hudson. Innova Ɵ ve 
eﬀ orts are proposed that directly support 
Governor’s ChargeNY ini Ɵ aƟ ve. 
First, implemen Ɵ ng EV Charging Sta Ɵ on Plans 
for the ﬁ  ve regions along the I-90 Corridor 
(Capital District, Mohawk Valley, Central New York, Genesee Valley/Finger Lakes, and Western New York) will spur EV acceptance and adop Ɵ on in regions that lag behind 
NYC’s and Long Island’s embrace of this clean technology. The outcome will be: 
 »25 EV charging sta Ɵ ons (5 in each region) 
strategically installed in cri Ɵ cal areas to 
enable greater EV use. 
 »Educated municipali Ɵ es on EV charging 
staƟ on permi ƫ  ng and communi Ɵ es on EV 
technology. 
 »900 rebates for EV purchases to spur EV sales and establish more EV advocates (the new EV owners), and 
 »40 ride-n-drive events to promote EVs and allow consumers a test drive opportunity of diﬀ erent makes and models.
Second, the Rochester EV Deployment Community will foster a model EV Community in which EVs are embraced by the public and promoted by business and government. This approach moves EVs from a niche product into a dominant and ubiquitous concept. The outcomes will be: 
 »9 EV charging sta Ɵ ons in City of Rochester 
g
arages for public and city-owned EVs. 
City of Rochester, NY | 23ROC FORWARD»»» »EVs for the City of Rochester as an 
ambassador of the technology and to showcase their opera Ɵ on. 
 »extensive community engagement to inform and educate the residents and businesses throughout the City about the bene ﬁ ts of EVs. The Rochester EV 
Deployment Community will create replicable models for other New York communi Ɵ es to use for accelera Ɵ ng EV 
adopƟ on.
DATA COLLECTION
Current Data Collec Ɵ on
The City has been con Ɵ nuously building 
capacity to capture and analyze data to inform decision making and measure outcomes. It has a history of sound prac Ɵ ce in these areas 
especially in areas of grant management outcome tracking and in the investment and planning decisions in the Department of Neighborhood and Business Development.
The City recently overhauled its Geographic 
InformaƟ on Systems and related IT 
infrastructure. This has greatly improved the access and sharing of data within the City organizaƟ ons of not only of GIS data, but all 
the City source data and other available public data.
In spring 2015 the City launched the O ﬃ  ce of 
InnovaƟ on and Strategic Ini Ɵ aƟ ves, a research 
and strategy team repor Ɵ ng to Mayor Lovely 
A. Warren. One major focus of the team is to 
ensure that scien Ɵ ﬁ c tracking and outcome 
measurement are the founda Ɵ on of any new 
City iniƟ aƟ ves. This is not only to help evaluate 
progress and track success, but also to posi Ɵ on 
iniƟ aƟ ves for more sustainable funding 
opportuni Ɵ es. 
The City and the O ﬃ  ce of Innova Ɵ on is an 
integral partner in the Rochester Monroe AnƟ poverty Ini Ɵ aƟ ve (RMAPI), a large 
consorƟ um of government and non-pro ﬁ ts 
working to impact poverty in Rochester. Together, the RMAPI and the City will insƟ tute an an Ɵ -poverty program in a pilot district to test e ﬀ ecƟ veness and measure 
impact. Through this partnership, the O ﬃ  ce 
of Innova Ɵ on will work with local and 
state experts to design metric tracking that taps into data assets from non-pro ﬁ ts and 
government agencies to track long-term individual outcomes and geographic trends. It will also work to implement best prac Ɵ ces 
in data security, and privacy standards. As these programs move toward implementa Ɵ on, 
staﬀ  responsible for sensi Ɵ ve personal data 
will undergo training on privacy and security protocol. 
The City currently has in place data sharing 
agreements with the City School District, the 
loc
al Library system, and Monroe County. It 
shares data on students, library patrons, and recreaƟ on center users. The City primarily 
shares property assessment data and street asset data with the County. The City has also has expanded data sharing in partnership with Gov. Cuomo’s Open NY data ini Ɵ aƟ ve. The 
Police Department also receives shared data from the NYS Department of CorrecƟ  ons and 
Community Supervision and other state and federal law enforcement agencies to help track and improve police strategy.
We have experience in and can leverage 
data from a variety of sources such as tra ﬃ  c 
cameras, other sensors, and social media to enable opportuni Ɵ es to opƟ mize opera Ɵ ons 
(traﬃ  c ﬂ ow, automated tra ﬃ  c sign detecƟ  on, 
and recogni Ɵ on), monitor infrastructure 
condiƟ ons (road condi Ɵ ons, snow condi Ɵ ons, 
pot holes), infrastructure planning (public transit), tra ﬃ  c enforcement (detec Ɵ ng 
passenger compartment viola Ɵ ons, speeding 
violaƟ ons), popula Ɵ on senƟ ment detec Ɵ on 
for city agency policies, and system health monitoring.
In addiƟ on to City data collec Ɵ on systems, 
Genesee Transporta Ɵ on Council (GTC) 
commissions an annual land use monitoring 
project conducted by the Monroe County Department of Planning and Development that includes the City of Rochester. The most recent year for which data collec Ɵ on and analysis is 
complete is 2014. 
GTC has also contracted with INRIX to provide 
probe-based travel Ɵ  me data for the region, 
City of Rochester, NY | 24ROC FORWARD»»»including access to INRIX Analy Ɵ cs. GTC 
has access to historic and real- Ɵ me travel 
data. GTC’s agreement with INRIX allows 
for member agencies, including the City of Rochester, to access and use this data.
GTC supports the Monroe County Department 
of Transporta Ɵ on’s (MCDOT) e ﬀ ort to collect 
traﬃ  c volume and classi ﬁ caƟ on counts 
in the City on a periodic basis. This data complements the e ﬀ orts of the New York State 
Department of Transporta Ɵ on (NYSDOT) to 
collect tra ﬃ  c volume and classi ﬁ caƟ on counts 
for the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS).
Further, GTC is responsible for the 
development and on-going maintenance of a Regional Travel Demand Model and regularly conducts analyses for member agencies, including the City of Rochester, and other municipali Ɵ es in the Rochester Metropolitan 
Planning Associa Ɵ on.
Regional Transit Service (RTS) collects the following data for the transit system:
 »Ridership data by route and stop based upon the use of the farebox on the bus.
 »Ridership data by route and stop based upon the number of people who walk on the and o ﬀ  the bus. 
 »Smartcard and fare media pass tracking by serial number.
 »Real-Time GPS loca Ɵ on of the bus at each 
stop.
 »Customer and organiza Ɵ on contact 
InformaƟ on through call center, fare 
media, social media, in person, and through e-mail.
A wealth of data is currently being collected, analyzed and employed to enhance the transporta Ɵ on system and the economic 
environment of the City.
New Data Collec Ɵ on
The essen Ɵ al goal for technologies addressing 
data collec Ɵ on is the wealth of disparate 
systems and data sources involved. This Big Data problem exists in every city today. This inability to collect, analyze, and sharing between the various city transporta Ɵ on 
systems and human service organiza Ɵ ons is 
common to most ci Ɵ es across our na Ɵ on. 
The development of a standardized set of data workﬂ  ow processes, security standards, 
architectural design, and search criteria, will bene ﬁ t many ciƟ  es by reducing this disparate 
data gathering and sharing processes. 
The City and RMAPI are currently working 
closely with the NYS Poverty Task Force, a group of high level state oﬃ   cials to formalize 
data sharing agreements with NYS OTDA/Monroe County Department of Human Services (Public Bene ﬁ ts), NYS Department of 
Labor, and NYS Department of Correc Ɵ ons and 
Community Supervision. We will expand this sharing agreement to include our addi Ɵ onal 
public partners (MCDOT, NYSDOT, RTS) as well as our private partners, (XEROX, IBM, GE, etc.) This will be essen Ɵ al to track and demonstrate 
long term outcomes for individuals interac Ɵ ng 
with the Smart City Challenge team.
The IBM Smarter CiƟ  es Challenge Report, 
dated January 27, 2016, provided a thorough 
outline for data collec Ɵ on and data governance 
as related to an Ɵ -poverty iniƟ  aƟ ves. In a 
coordinaƟ on eﬀ ort, our team will adopt a 
similar structure as described in the following manner:

ARCHITECTURE, STANDARDS & PROCESSES
The City of Rochester and other regional transporta Ɵ on agencies (GTC, Monroe 
County, and NYSDOT) who are par Ɵ cipaƟ ng 
in this project are also par Ɵ cipaƟ ng in the 
development and update of the Rochester’s Regional ITS Architecture. Projects from the 2011 ITS Strategic Plan are integrated into the Regional ITS Architecture and evaluated for consistency with the New York State-wide ITS Architecture. Updates to the Regional ITS Architecture are undertaken as o Ō en as 
needed. The 2011 ITS Strategic Plan called for applying a consistent set of standards to tra ﬃ  c 
signals, communica Ɵ ons, and data interchange 
across the region. All projects undergo a governance review to ensure they conform to the recommenda Ɵ ons of the strategic plan and 
ITS architecture. Furthermore, when developing the system requirements for our Smart City vision we will ensure compliancy with IEEE and ISO Standards as established by IEEE 1233: correct, compaƟ ble, complete, feasible, veri ﬁ able, 
traceable, and modi ﬁ able. The requirements 
will be developed based on USDOT guidance as well.
With respect to interacƟ  ng and sharing lessons 
learned with the standards development 
organizaƟ ons (SDOs), a number of state and 
regional transporta Ɵ on staﬀ  are acƟ ve and 
parƟ cipate in ITS standard development 
eﬀ orts. Our private sector partners are 
naƟ onal and interna Ɵ onal leaders in the US 
standard development ac Ɵ viƟ es. For example, 
Koorosh Olyai is the chair of the US delega Ɵ on 
to the Interna Ɵ onal Standards Organiza Ɵ on 
Technical Commi Ʃ ee 204 (ISO TC 204) which is 
responsible for development of ITS Standards as well as a harmonized connected vehicle (CV) suite of standards. Our team members are also members of the SAE and IEEE connected vehicle and communica Ɵ ons standards groups 
who are promulga Ɵ ng Internet of Things (IoT), 
Communica Ɵ ons (DSRC), Big Data, Connected 
Vehicle (CV) and Automated Vehicle (AV) standards. These are cri Ɵ cal in deploying a 
consistent set of standards for this challenge. We strongly support development of standards for interoperability purposes na Ɵ onally.

GOALS & OBJECTIVES
When you look at the history of transporta Ɵ on 
in our community, the economy of the City of Rochester has been determined in no small part by transporta Ɵ on assets, such as 
the Erie Canal, the railroads, and the growth of the interstate system. Now, building on these assets, the City of Rochester’s vision is structured to strengthen our transporta Ɵ on 
network in the 21st Century by leveraging advanced technologies to address the challenges we have in safety, mobility, sustainability, economic vitality, and climate change. Rochester is ready to connect everything.
Rochester will move be Ʃ er by 
enhancing mobility.
In the 21st Century, Rochester will focus on the overall connec Ɵ vity of our neighborhoods. We 
will provide Rochesterians with the needed access to reliable, a ﬀ ordable transporta Ɵ on 
that provides opportuni Ɵ es for employment, 
child care, health care, educa Ɵ on, as well as 
all of the other services residents and families need. As men Ɵ oned previously, Rochester 
has the second-highest poverty rate in the naƟ on, resul Ɵ ng in a situa Ɵ on that threatens 
our community’s economic future. Enhanced mobility is one avenue to help turn this situaƟ on around.
 »Rochester will test automated vehicle performance in a four-season climate. 
 »Rochester will demonstrate that an enhanced transit service can make a posiƟ ve impact on low income residents. 
 »Rochester will provide real- Ɵ me traveler 
informaƟ on and emerging mobility services 
to improve personal mobility. 
 »Rochester will increase mobility for pedestrian and bicycle access. »Rochester will focus mobility improvements on our overall demographics (e.g. aging popula Ɵ on, 
disabled, millennials, etc.). 
Rochester will improve safety.
By using advanced technologies, including CV technologies, Rochester will reduce the number and severity of collisions, resul Ɵ ng in 
fewer fataliƟ  es and injuries.E ﬃ  ciency is at the 
forefront of Rochester’s vision for the future. 
Rochester will focus on crea Ɵ ng a connected 
community that will provide the infrastructure 
for the future. 
 »In the 21st Century, everyone needs the ability to be connected and therefore the City of Rochester will be incorpora Ɵ ng a 
City-wide Wi-Fi network. 
 »Smart Road technology will also be incorporated to make sure that every signalized intersec Ɵ on within the City of 
Rochester has the ability to adapt to the changing tra ﬃ  c condiƟ ons. 
Rochester will build for a 
sustainable future. 
Rochester’s primary goal is to build a thriving 
liveable community throughout the city that provides access, neighborhood cohesion, opportunity, economic compe Ɵ Ɵ veness, and a 
“sense of place.” 
Rochester will adapt to a changing 
climate. 
The technologies implemented by the City 
of Rochester will support a more sustainable relaƟ onship between transporta Ɵ on and the 
environment through fuel use and emissions reducƟ  ons. 
Upon selecƟ  on as a Smart City Challenge 
Finalist, the City of Rochester will work with our consor Ɵ um partners to iden Ɵ fy a set of 
targeted performance measures that relate to the primary impact of our deployment. The deployed technologies will be capable of generaƟ ng the data needed to demonstrate 
how well the system is performing with respect to the iden Ɵ ﬁ ed target measures. 
City of Rochester, NY | 27ROC FORWARD»»»EVIDENCE OF 
CAPACITY
The City of Rochester has a long history of delivering high-quality, large-scale public projects u Ɵ lizing federal funding. The most 
current example of this is the Inner Loop East Transforma Ɵ on project, currently under 
construcƟ  on. This $24 million project received 
$17.7 million in TIGER funding in 2013 to remove a deteriorated and underu Ɵ lized 
secƟ on of the Inner Loop Expressway in 
Downtown Rochester and replace it with a new high quality complete street. This project will reconnect neighborhoods, remove structurally-de ﬁ cient bridges, encourage 
walking and biking, and create over six acres of land for redevelopment that will generate jobs and leverage private investment. This project is being developed by the City of Rochester on schedule and on budget. Other Recent examples of major federally-funded City transporta Ɵ on projects include:
 »Midtown Rising Redevelopment , a $100 
million project, is signi ﬁ cantly shaping the 
rebirth of the downtown core through major public and private investment, job creaƟ on, and infrastructure 
development. At the heart of the project is the rehabilita Ɵ on of the nearly 9-acre 
former Midtown Plaza into a mixed-use area designed to a Ʃ ract a criƟ  cal 
mass of residents and 24/7 ameni Ɵ es 
that contribute to a vibrant live-work environment. This project has created a resurgence of downtown acƟ  vity and is 
currently rede ﬁ ning Rochester’s City Center 
for future genera Ɵ ons. 
 »The Broad Street Tunnel Reconstruc Ɵ on 
project , a $23 million project completed 
in 2011 which ﬁ lled in a deteriora Ɵ ng 
subsurface tunnel and fully reconstructed a major surface arterial. 
 »The Port of Rochester Infrastructure Improvements project , a $40 million 
project that constructed new streets, sidewalks, ligh Ɵ ng, drainage, parking, 
mulƟ -use trails, and public space on 
a previously-unde ﬁ ned parking area 
surrounding the historic Port Terminal Building. 
Ground Breaking Ceremony for the Inner Loop East Transforma Ɵ on Project
City of Rochester, NY | 28ROC FORWARD»»»ExecuƟ  ve Commitment:  The City of Rochester 
will be the grant recipient and primary point 
of contact responsible for federal grant administra Ɵ on and repor Ɵ ng procedures. 
Mayor Lovely Warren, as demonstrated by the cover leƩ er to this applica Ɵ on, is commi Ʃ ed to 
successful delivery of our Smart City vision.
Workforce Capacity:  The City of Rochester has 
an excellent working rela Ɵ onship with local 
labor unions. In fact, for three of the projects 
listed above, the City developed project labor agreements (PLA’s) with the local unions to assure that su ﬃ  cient workforce capacity is 
available in the Region. The City of Rochester, along with the local unions, is very proud of their teaming abili Ɵ es and past successes. 
Likewise, the region has well-established partnerships for workforce development through regional academic partners such as Monroe Community College. Should Rochester be chosen as a Smart City Challenge ﬁ nalist, 
the City will work with regional partners to create a workforce development strategy to ensure that the local labor force is ready and equipped for the economic opportuni Ɵ es that 
will arise.
Degree of Infrastructure Readiness:  The 
transporta Ɵ on infrastructure of the City of 
Rochester is already well-prepared to meet the 
needs of the Smart City Challenge. The tra ﬃ  c 
signal system is computerized and coordinated remotely from the Regional Tra ﬃ  c OperaƟ ons 
Center, where tra ﬃ  c monitoring capabili Ɵ es 
are acƟ ve 24/7. Likewise, the RTS transit ﬂ  eet 
is ouƞ iƩ ed with CAD/AVL and provides real-
Ɵ me arrival and status informa Ɵ on to the 
public through mul Ɵ ple plaƞ orms. There is an 
expansive municipal ﬁ ber network in the city 
with excess capacity.
Data & Performance Management 
CapabiliƟ es: The City and consor Ɵ um 
partners already collect and analyze data for a wide variety of municipal applica Ɵ ons and 
public informa Ɵ on. The City’s Department 
of Informa Ɵ on Technology is well aware of 
the Smart City Challenge and is prepared to accommodate any and all requirements in coordinaƟ on with our partners.LEVERAGING FEDERAL RESOURCES
It is anƟ cipated that opportuni Ɵ es for cost-
sharing and in-kind service delivery will be made available through the City and its project partners. The ability to leverage the federal resources provided through the Smart City Challenge to a Ʃ ract addi Ɵ onal ﬁ nancial and 
technical assistance will help to ensure that Rochester’s Smart City vision produces a real and long-las Ɵ ng impact on Rochester, New 
York State, and the na Ɵ on as a whole. Upon 
noƟ ﬁ caƟ on as a Smart City Challenge ﬁ nalist, 
the City will work with our consor Ɵ um of 
partners to secure commitments to leverage addiƟ onal funding and/or in-kind products and 
services. 
ROC Forward: creaƟ  ng a smart, sustainable 
city for the 21st Century.
